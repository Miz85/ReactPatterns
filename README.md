# The basics

From the ReactPatterns folder you can run wcd on Windows to change to one of the project folders.

Open two terminals at the desired project root. I use iTerm on Mac, ConEmu on Windows 10. First time do "npm install". In one terminal "gulp". In the other terminal "npm start". In your browser localhost:3500. All projects use the same port. If you want to do it with one terminal session you can run "gulp nw" for no watch.
