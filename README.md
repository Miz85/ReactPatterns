# ReactPatterns

A collection of simple react projects providing reusable components, startup and test examples. Its my react playground.
I use gulp, browserify and babel for the build tool chain. With React.12 I used React.createClass. In React.13 I started using extends React.Component. Now with React.14 I am using babel stage 0 with arrow functions and let instead of var.

There are not any React-Router examples yet because I have been building applications instead of websites so far.

# The basics

From the ReactPatterns folder you can run wcd on Windows to change to one of the project folders.

Open two terminals at the desired project root. I use iTerm on Mac, ConEmu on Windows 10. First time do "npm install". In one terminal "gulp". In the other terminal "npm start". In your browser localhost:3500. All projects use the same port. If you want to do it with one terminal session you can run "gulp nw" for no watch.


A demo of the Drag and Drop pattern is at http://example.calitek.com/.
