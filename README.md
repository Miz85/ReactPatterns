# The basics

From the ReactPatterns folder you can run wcd on Windows to change to one of the project folders.

The very first time open React.13/Common/config.json and edit the ProjectRoot. Then open React.13/Common in a terminal. npm install then gulp. This sets up some common files.

Open two terminals at the desired project root. I use iTerm on Mac, ConEmu on Windows 10. First time do npm install. In one terminal gulp. In the other terminal npm start. In your browser localhost:3500. All projects use the same port.
