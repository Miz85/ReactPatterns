# ReactPatterns .14 DragAndDrop

This is the basic drag and drop pattern applied to a list. The same pattern should be useful on other drag and drop uses. It uses the html drag and drop events. The primary need is to have an id for the elements in use. Some browsers do not support the drag and drop events in a text div so there is a second pattern that uses an image.
